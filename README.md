Internship Group Project: Automated Access Control Using Real-Time Facial Recognition

· Engineered a complete face recognition system using OpenCV, developing modules for user enrollment, face encoding, real-time attendance logging, and automated reporting with timestamped entry/exit records.

· Implemented advanced face tracking and persistence algorithms with configurable exit delays, significantly improving recognition accuracy and eliminating false exits during temporary face movements or occlusions.

· Designed and integrated a robust database system for facial encodings and attendance logs, creating an end-to-end automated access control solution that replaced manual processes with secure, contactless identification.
